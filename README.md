## Environment

* operating system: MacOS Mojave 10.14.5

* Programming language: c++

## Compile

For parallel (rectangular domains) version code:
> mpic++ game_life_grid.cpp

For parallel (horizontal strips) version code:
> mpic++ game_life_strips.cpp

For serial version code:
> g++ game_life_serial.cpp


# Run

Parallel code: (using 4 processor to run the program as example)
> mpirun -np 4 ./a. out

Serial code:
> ./a. out



## Overview

This assignment is aim to write a parallel version of Conway’s Game of Life by using c++ and MPI. This assignment consists of followsing parts:

* readme file of this assignment: "README.md"

* serial version code for Game of Life: "game_life_serial.cpp"

* parallel version (horizontal strips) code for Game of Life: "game_life_strips.cpp"

* parallel version (rectangular domains) code for Game of Life: "game_life_grid.cpp"

* three txt files I used for performance evaluation: "1000.txt", "3000.txt" and "5000.txt" 

* python code to merge separate txt.file generated by "gam_life_strips" : "merge_strips.py"

* python code to merge separate txt.file generated by "gam_life_grid" : "merge_grid.py"

* postprocessing script merging separate results generated by each processor and visualizing simulation of the game: "Postprocessing.ipynb"

* a report for program’s performance: "GameofLife_Report.pdf"


## User guidance

In each .cpp file, there are four parameters can be modified by users

For parallel version code, there are some essential parameters which determine the game status, namely:
* **bool** periodic; (true for periodic boundary, false for fixed boundary)
* **int** n; (the number of rows in the domain)
* **int** m; (the number of columns in the domain)
* **int** num_step; (the total number of steps of the game)



For two merge python code, there are some essential parameters need to be inputted, namely:

* **int** n; (the number of processor in Longitudinal direction)
* **int** m; (the number of processor in horizontal direction)
* **int** num_step; (the total number of steps of the game)

## Explain the output data format for two parallel version codes:

For parallel (horizontal strips) version code: 

* The code needs to read a input txt.file

* The output data has several txt.file (such as: 1 step(0).txt, it means the result obtained by processor 0 in the first step)

* Then using "merge_strip.py" to merge these separate txt.file (such as 1.txt, it means that result in the first step)


For parallel (rectangular domains) version code: 

* At the beginning, each processor randomly generates data

* The output data has several txt.file (for example: 0 step(0,0).txt, it means the result obtained by processor 0 at the beginning; 0 step(0,1).txt, it means the result obtained by processor 1 at the beginning; 1 step(1,0).txt, it means the result obtained by processor 2 at the beginning; 0 step(1,1).txt, it means the result obtained by processor 4 at the beginning.)

* Then using "merge_grid.py" to merge these separate txt.file (such as 1.txt, it means that result in the first step)
